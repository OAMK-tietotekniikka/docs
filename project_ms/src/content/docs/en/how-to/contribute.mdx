## Open Development Philosophy

All development work on Project MS happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/OAMK-tietotekniikka/ProjectsMS).
Team members send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Getting Started

### Branch Management

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work.
It's important that each group of changes be done in separate branches to ensure that a pull request only includes the commits related to that bug or feature.

#### Branch Naming Convention

Follow this standardized format for branch names:

```
<prefix>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

**Examples:**
- `feat/123-add-test-controller`
- `bugfix/124-fix-tests`
- `docs/125-update-contribution-guide`

**Available Prefixes:**
- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical bug fixes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code restructuring
- `test/` - Test-related changes
- `release/` - Release preparations

Please use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)


## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **Comments**: Include clear, descriptive comments explaining complex logic
- **Testing**: Since the project currently has no automated test coverage, please test all functionality manually before submitting
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation when adding new features or changing existing behavior

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages that follow our established conventions.
Clear and consistent commit messages make the project easier to understand and work with.
They also help Git tools display commits in a well-organized way

## Submitting Changes
---

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch**: After completing your changes and testing, push your commits to your branch
2. **Create pull request**: Submit a pull request to the `/staging` branch (not `main`)
3. **Code review**: Wait for team review and address any feedback

:::danger[Important]
**Never create pull requests to the `main` branch** - they will be rejected.
All contributions must target the `staging` branch first.

### For Reviewers

To maintain a clean Git history, always use `Squash and merge` when merging pull requests.
This way, it doesn't matter how many commits PR has, as they will end up being a single commit after merging

This is done to make a much cleaner git log history and helps to find regressions
