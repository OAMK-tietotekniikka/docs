We follow the Conventional Commits standard to keep our commit history clear and consistent.
You can read a quick summary of the rules [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

### Commit Format

Every time you make a commit, a pre-commit hook (using **Husky** and **Commitlint**) will run automatically.

If your commit message doesnâ€™t follow the required format:
- You'll get an error message
- The commit will be **aborted** and **stashed**

To avoid this, just follow the correct commit message format. It helps keep our project history clean and easy to understand.
<Aside type="note">
    It's possible to bypass the pre-commit hook using the `-n` flag:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "some message" -n
    ```
</Aside>

**Correct commit**

```txt "feat:" "(#123)"
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs (#123)
```

**Incorrect commit**

```txt
send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

<Aside type="note">
    Always include the related issue number at the end of the commit message in parentheses, e.g. (#123).
    This helps track code changes to specific tasks or bugs in the issue tracker
</Aside>


**Available Prefixes**

All available commit prefixes (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`) are defined in `commitlint.config.js` (root folder)
