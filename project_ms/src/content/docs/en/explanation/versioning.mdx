We follow a versioning scheme similar to **[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/)**. This document outlines our versioning practices and how to update the version number.

-----

### Versioning Scheme

Our version format is
```txt "MAJOR" "MINOR" "PATCH"
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH # (e.g 1.2.3)
```
  * <Badge text="MAJOR" variant="tip"/>: Incremented for any breaking changes.
  * <Badge text="MINOR" variant="note"/>: Incremented for new, backward-compatible features or non-essential changes.
  * <Badge text="PATCH" variant="success"/>: Incremented for critical, backward-compatible bug fixes.

Until the first stable release (`1.0.0`), all versions will start with a leading zero (e.g., `0.2.1`). <br/>
Every significant change should be documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

-----

### How to Update the Version

Version updates are currently a manual process.
We recommend using **[git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/)** to help generate the changelog from your git history.

Steps to update the project version:

```bash
# 1. Set the new version number as an environment variable
NEW_VERSION="v1.2.0"

# 2. Update the version in package.json without creating a git tag yet
npm version ${NEW_VERSION#v} --no-git-tag-version

# 3. Generate the changelog for the new version
git cliff -t $NEW_VERSION -o CHANGELOG.md


# 4. Stage the updated files
git add CHANGELOG.md package.json

# 5. Commit the changes with a conventional commit message
git commit -m "chore(release): prepare for $NEW_VERSION"

# 6. Create an annotated git tag for the release
git tag -a $NEW_VERSION -m "Release $NEW_VERSION"

# 7. Push the commit and tags to the remote repository
git push <origin> <branch> --tags
```

### Process & Future Automation

- This update process should be performed when pushing or merging a release into the `main` or `staging` branch.

- Currently, updates must be done manually due to inconsistent commit messages.

- After a stable release, version management and changelog generation will be automated using a tool like `git-cliff`
