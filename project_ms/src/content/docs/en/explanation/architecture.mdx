### Frontend service

**Technology:** React 19 and TypeScript

**Key features:**

* **Student interface:** Provides tools and views for student tasks
* **Teacher interface:** Supports class and resource management
* **Authentication:** Integrates with Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and handles user state
* **Responsive design:** Adapts to desktop and mobile screen sizes

**Communication:** Uses REST APIs to interact with backend services

### Backend service

**Technology:** Node.js 24+ with Express

**Key features:**

* **Authentication and authorization:** Uses MSAL id tokens to control access
* **Security:** Applies rate limiting and input validation
* **Email support:** Sends emails using EmailLabs
* **Logging:** Writes log data to files for monitoring and debugging

**API documentation:** Defined with the OpenAPI specification

---

### Database layer

* **Primary database:** MariaDB 11 or later
* **Cache:** Redis, used to improve query performance
